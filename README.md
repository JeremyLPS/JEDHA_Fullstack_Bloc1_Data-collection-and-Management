JEDHA_Bloc1_DataCollection
This repository contains my data infrastructure, data colleciton and management project for the validation of Bloc 1 of the RNCP certificate.

Here is the description of the project:

Plan your trip with Kayak
Company's description üìá
Kayak is a travel search engine that helps user plan their next trip at the best price.

Project üöß
The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

Weather
Hotels in the area
The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

Goals üéØ
As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to:

Scrape data from destinations
Get weather data from each destination
Get hotels' info about each destination
Store all the information above in a data lake
Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse

Deliverable üì¨

A SQL Database where we should be able to get the same cleaned data from S3

Two maps where you should have a Top-5 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area. You can use plotly or any other library to do so. It should look something like this:
